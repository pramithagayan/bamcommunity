You can install popular Discourse theme components from the Popular tab, or import via your device or a repository link by clicking on the respective tabs.

The repository link for each theme is provided by the author on the theme topic. There are also options to import from a specific branch and to specify whether the repository is private.

If you import a theme component, you need to also add it to your actives themes. This is covered in detail in the next section.

#### Add theme components to a theme

Let's say you like the [Discourse category banners](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-category-banners/86241) theme component and want to use it. You would proceed as follows

1. Import the theme from the repository like we discussed above
2. Add it as a theme component to your active / user-selectable themes

You can add the component your theme(s) using the "Include component on these themes" setting:

You can also add components from a theme's overview using the "Included components" setting:

#### Checking for updates

Sometimes the themes or components you install will have updates.

If a theme or component has updates, an icon will display next to its name like so:

If you select that theme or component you can update it with one click by clicking on the update button here:
